Hi i have a client requirements i'm sharding with you client wants a crm in short a super admin panel
client has different projects with us and live and client wants to manage and allow other user to register to their this crm --> super admin panel 
and select which company access they want to have etc
Got it. I’ve read the full client document and the dashboard demo, and this is not a normal CRM — this is a multi-tenant enterprise CRM + ERP control center.

I’ll break it down clearly, practically, and in implementation terms, not marketing talk.

1️⃣ What the Client ACTUALLY Wants (in simple words)

Your client wants ONE CENTRAL SYSTEM that:

Acts as Super Admin / Brain

Manages multiple existing + future projects

Allows other companies & users to register

Controls what each company can access

Prevents duplicate customers across all portals

Keeps frontend portals separate, backend unified

This is LEO24 CRM = Central Hub, exactly as written in their requirements 

LEO24_CRM_Final_COMPLETE_No_Mis…

2️⃣ Core Concept (Very Important)
This is a MULTI-TENANT CRM

Think like this:

SUPER ADMIN (You / Client)
   |
   ├── Company A
   |     ├── Users
   |     ├── Projects (OptyShop, TG Calabria…)
   |
   ├── Company B
   |     ├── Users
   |     ├── Projects (MyDoctor+, MyTaxy…)


One codebase

One database

Logical separation by company_id

Role + Permission based access

3️⃣ Roles Structure (Must-Have)
🔑 System Roles
Role	Powers
Super Admin	Everything (all companies, all projects, all data)
Company Admin	Only their company
Manager	Selected modules
Staff / Agent	Limited access
Read-only	View only

Every user belongs to ONE company, never global.

4️⃣ Company & Project Access Logic (Key Requirement)

When a company registers or is created:

Super Admin selects:

✅ Which projects/portals they can access

✅ Which CRM modules they can use

✅ Sector type (medical, real estate, jobs, etc.)

Example:

Company: Alpha SRL
Access:
✔ OptyShop
✔ TGImmobiliare
✖ MyDoctor+
✖ MyTaxy


This is enforced at:

API level

UI level

Database level

5️⃣ Single Source of Truth (CRITICAL)

From the document 

LEO24_CRM_Final_COMPLETE_No_Mis…

:

❌ No duplicate customers
✅ One customer profile shared across all portals

How this works technically:

One customers table

Unique constraints:

Email

Phone

VAT / CF

Every portal sends data → CRM API

CRM checks:

Exists? → link

Not exists? → create

No portal is allowed to store final customer data.

6️⃣ Portal Integration Rule (Important)

Existing portals (OptyShop, MyDoctor+, etc):

❌ No CRM logic inside

❌ No customer duplication

✅ Only:

Forms

Orders

Bookings

Requests

They communicate via:

REST API

Webhooks

API Gateway (future-ready)

7️⃣ Registration Flow (Company + Users)
Company Registration

Company signs up

Status = PENDING

Super Admin approves

Projects + modules assigned

Company activated

User Registration

Either:

Invited by Company Admin

Or registered & approved

Assigned:

Role

Module permissions

Project access

8️⃣ Modules Are PLUGGABLE (Scalable Design)

CRM is MODULAR, not monolithic.

Examples:

CRM Marketing

CRM Assistance

Call Center

Inventory

Invoices

Projects

Geo-marketing

Email campaigns

Each module:

Can be enabled/disabled per company

Can be extended later without breaking system

9️⃣ Security & Data Isolation (Non-Negotiable)

Rules enforced everywhere:

company_id on every table

Policies / Guards / Middleware

Users only see their company data

Super Admin bypasses all

GDPR-sensitive data:

CVs

Medical info

Contracts

→ Encrypted + restricted

🔟 Technology Direction (Practical Advice)
Backend (Recommended)

Laravel (perfect for this)

Multi-tenant architecture

API-first design

Queue jobs (emails, sync, imports)

Frontend

Admin panel (Blade / React / Vue)

Existing portals remain untouched

Database

MySQL / PostgreSQL

Strict indexes

Soft deletes

Audit logs

1️⃣1️⃣ How You Should Explain This to the Client (Short Version)

“We’ll build a central CRM platform where each company has its own isolated workspace.
You (Super Admin) control which projects, modules, and permissions each company gets.
All portals connect to the CRM, but don’t store final data.
This avoids duplication, improves control, and allows infinite future expansion.”

1️⃣2️⃣ Reality Check (Important)

⚠️ This is NOT:

A small CRM

A quick MVP

A cheap plugin-based system

✔️ This IS:

Enterprise-level software

Long-term evolving platform

Multi-phase development

If the client expects cheap + fast, expectations must be corrected early.

Next Step (Tell me)

Do you want me to:
1️⃣ Design database schema (tables + relations)
2️⃣ Create module-wise development phases
3️⃣ Write a technical proposal for client
4️⃣ Design permission & role matrix
